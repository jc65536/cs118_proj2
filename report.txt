We implemented the TCP congestion control scheme:
- initial cwnd = 1, ssthresh = 6 (arbitrary small number)
- Slow start
    Each new ACK increases cwnd by 1
    When cwnd >= ssthresh, we transition to congestion avoidance
- Congestion avoidance
    Each new ACK increases cwnd by 1/cwnd
- Fast recovery
    When 3 duplicate ACKs are detected, ssthresh is set to cwnd/2 and cwnd is set to ssthresh+3
    With every additional duplicate ACK received in FR, cwnd increments by 1
    When a new ACK is received, we return to congestion avoidance and set cwnd to ssthresh

Upon timeout, ssthresh is set to cwnd/2 and cwnd is reset to 1 and we return to slow start
