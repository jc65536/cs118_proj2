Our congestion control mostly follows TCP congestion control. We implemented
slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmission, fast recovery, and
retransmission timeout.

We also added a feature where ACKs could enumerate ranges of missing packets
(called "holes" in the code). This way, when the client performs retransmission,
a whole interval of packets can be retransmitted at once, which saves a lot of
timeout intervals.

Furthermore, the holes feature allows us to implement a sort of selective ACK,
which can help save some time since we can partially ACK ranges of packets
rather than waiting for the cumulative ACK.
