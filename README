Our congestion control mostly follows TCP congestion control. We implemented
slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmission, fast recovery, and
retransmission timeout.

We also added a feature where ACKs could enumerate missing packets (called
"holes" in the code). This way, upon retransmission, multiple packets can be
retransmitted at once, which saves a lot of timeout intervals.
